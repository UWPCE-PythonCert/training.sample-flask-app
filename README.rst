Flask Microblog
***************

This is a microblog app, based on the `flask tutorial`_ from the excellent
`flask documentation`_.

The primary difference between this and the original tutorial is that here the
functions related to database access have been split out from the functions
related to viewing the application.  This leads to a better separation of
concerns and improved testability for the app over-all.

This version of the microblog app is intended for use as an instructional tool
and is in no way suitable for production use.
